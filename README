# Context

* You have a directory wiht stuff and you can extract strings from this stuff
  using the command "strings".
* You are lazy and don't want to open all this files to see what they contains.
* You know that some of this files contains some particular words (ex: a name)
* You have a lot of memory available (at least the same size than all the files
  you want to search in)

# Requirements

* Linux
* redis (http://redis.io/, https://github.com/antirez/redis)
* redis-py (https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py)
* ipython (optional but I like it)

# Usage

* Run a redis server
* Edit directory in strings_generator.py
* Run strings_generator.py in an interactive python shell (like ipython)
