Written by Josiah Carlson July 3, 2010

Released into the public domain.


This module implements a simple TF/IDF indexing and search algorithm using
Redis as a datastore server.  The particular algorithm implemented uses the
standard TF/IDF scoring of (using Python notation):

    sum((document.count(term) / len(document)) *
         log(index.doc_count() / len(index.docs_with(term)), 2)
         for term in terms)
